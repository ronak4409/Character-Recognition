Project Description
-------------------

Every cylinder has unique identification code (UID code) engraved on it. This UID code is used to differentiate between cylinders belonging to different distributors and also differentiate between tested & untested cylinders. But, engraved codes are prone to rusting, paint erosion, chemical corrosion, etc. Since, almost all firms use same metal cylinders for more than a few months, the engraved UID code becomes difficult to detect and read. This method of engraving the UID codes on the hardware is now being replaced by putting up stick-on and/or adding a plastic tag.

Also, in developing countries like India, labourers that are used for loading and unloading of cylinders and maintaining the database have poor literacy. 

So as per our case study, following manually occurring problems were observed:
+   labourers find it very difficult to read the code, resulting in faulty readings
+   human entry errors like missing character, duplicate characters, incorrect sequence
+   UID codes are noted on challans, but illegible handwriting makes it difficult to understand for data entry operator
+   less accessibility in obtaining uid codes for closely packed array of cylinders
+   poorly illuminated areas in warehouses

Thus, there exists a high probability that the data entry by the operator, managing the cylinder inventory software receives wrong UID codes & registers faulty data. 
Issues that arise due to these problems:
+   Error in cylinder tracking and maintenance
+   As per safety regulations, every cylinder has to pass hydro-test and explosive test after specified period of time. Due to wrong entry for the particular cylinder, the cylinder cannot be tracked & it may lead to hazardous consequences.
+   Also, these cylinders are used on rent basis. Wrong data results in error in rent calculation.
+   Some cylinders are lost in this process and the owner has to bear the losses
